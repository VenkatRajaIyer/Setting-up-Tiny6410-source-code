1) Download the files present in the location (If you download teh zip file, have them unzipped)
    
2) You can copy those packages into /home/$MACHINE_NAME/mini6410/ 
	(If you are using the UI, you don't have to create the folder with your machine name. Simply create the folder mini6410 under home directory)

3) Open the terminal and switch to the super user. You would have to type the administrator's password if prompted
    Type in 'sudo su'
    
3) Extract the downloaded packages into /opt directory. To do that, type in the following commands in th terminal.
    tar -xvzf arm-linux-gcc-4.5.1-v6-vfp-20101103.tgz -C /
    mkdir /opt/FriendlyARM/mini6410
    mv /opt/FriendlyARM/toolschain /opt/FriendlyARM/mini6410
    tar -xvzf linux-2.6.38-20110718.tar.gz -C /opt/FriendlyARM/mini6410/                                                                                                             installed)

4) Type in 'gedit ~/.bashrc &' in the terminal

    export PATH=$PATH:/opt/FriendlyARM/mini6410/toolschain/4.5.1/bin
    You might then have to close the terminal and reopen it.
    
5) Go to /home/$MACHINE_NAME/mini6410/mini6410_Samsung-master and type in the follwoing	
	cp config.txt /opt/FriendlyARM/mini6410/linux-2.6.38/
	cd /opt/FriendlyARM/mini6410/linux-2.6.38/
	mv config.txt .config
	sudo apt-get install ncurses-dev
    make
	
	If you have installed a 64 bit ubuntu, and as ARM11 is a 32 bit machine, you would have to install some additional libraries

	sudo apt-get install lib32ncurses5
	sudo apt-get install lib32z1
	
6) Type in arm-linux-gcc -v and check if you can see the gcc version to ensure that you have installed the gcc crosscompiler properly

    tar -xvzf /home/$MACHINE_NAME/mini6410/examples-mini6410-20110104.tgz -C /opt/FriendlyARM/mini6410/linux-2.6.38/
    
8) To view the kernel configuration file, navigate to the following location
